# TP1 – HCI / UCD

## 1) User Need(s)
A user need is an expectation related to the use of an interface.  
In my project, I addressed the need for **simplicity and clarity**: allowing the user to navigate quickly thanks to a clear navigation bar and an identifiable logo.

## 2) User-Centered Design Process
The steps of the User-Centered Design process are:  
1. Observe the usage context  
2. Identify user needs  
3. Create mockups or prototypes  
4. Test with users  
5. Improve through iterations  

I am currently at step **3 – designing mockups** in Figma (mobile interface for scuba diving, with animated logo and navigation bar).

## 3) Adding Observers
I presented my project to classmates, who gave me advice on colors and the positioning of the logo across the pages.  
This corresponds to a fundamental principle of UCD: **involving users** in order to gather their feedback.

## 4) Layers Definition and Best Practices
A layer is a distinct graphical element in Figma.  

**Best practices applied:**
- Layers named properly (logo, icons, texts)  
- Clear hierarchical organization  
- Groups used to structure screens

## 5) Definition of a Component
A component is a **reusable element**.  
In my project, the **navigation bar and its buttons** (Presentation, Pricing, Help) were designed as components to be reused across several screens.
